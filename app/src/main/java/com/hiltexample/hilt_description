Hilt === DI (Dependency Injection)

It means we are Injecting Our Dependencies to the Dependent

Here

DEPENDENCIES:
(Dependencies Means like Room Data Base we need to create only single object for room DB & Retrofit and Notification
in this case we can consider all these as Dependencies

DEPENDENT:
and coming to Dependent is like Activities or Fragments which we need to use



Example:

Room Db , Retrofit , Repository === > All these are Dependencies (No Annotations) Must be confined in Module Class

ViewModel,Activity, Fragment(Android Components like Activity , Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers , Service) == > All these are Dependents (Start with Annotations)

 Activity (@AndroidEntryPoint)
 Broadcast Receivers (@AndroidEntryPoint)
 Content Providers (@AndroidEntryPoint)
 Service (@AndroidEntryPoint)
 ViewModel (@HiltViewModel)
 Application Class (@HiltAndroidApp)



Annotations :
    @Inject
    @Field
    @Installin
    @AndroidEntryPoint
    @HiltApplication
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    @InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)


    @SingletonComponent
    @ViewModelComponent
    @ActivityComponent
    @FragmentComponent
    @ViewComponent
    @ServiceComponent
